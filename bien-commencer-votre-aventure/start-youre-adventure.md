# Start your adventure

## The first step is to find a place to play !

The simplest way would be to join the support server! To join us, use this link below:

{% embed url="http://discord.gg/WwgBfSg" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also add the bot to your server! (the link is on the bot server)
{% endhint %}

Once you have joined the server, a welcoming message will appear like this:

To start the adventure, press "Try Draftbot in English", then use the command `/report`.

Following this, the bot tutorial will start. Just follow the bot instructions to continue.

Another important command to know is the command `/help.`This command will give you the list of all the commands you can use. Try them all!

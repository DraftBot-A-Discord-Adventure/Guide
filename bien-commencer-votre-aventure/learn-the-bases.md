# Learn the basics

### What is the gameplay about ?

It's a real-time role-playing game, which means you won't have to loop commands but you'll have to monitor your character's progress regularly.

### Advices for a quick start

#### Report regularly

When a player requests a report, he collects the points won by the character he controls to which is added a small bonus. After a while, the character stops collecting points, so make sure to make the deferral command regularly. However, you have to wait at least 10 min between reports to give the character some time to wait for new unexpected events. There are many other information about the technicalities of [`/report`](../notions-principale/report.md) in the dedicated wiki page

### Lexicon

During your game and if you choose to take part in the community and talk about the bot, you will bump into some vocabulary used to describe specific elements of the game. Here's a list of the main ones:

:exclamation: **Event**: An event may happen when the player executes the `/report` command. If an event occurs, the player will have to choose between different options

:question: **Mini event**: Between 2 events, the player can obtain small events. There is one circa every 9 minutes and 45 seconds and they don't need much interaction (aside typing `/report`)

:moneybag: **Money**: Money is the currency of the game. (yes the name is original) It is possible to use it by executing the `/shop`command. Having money will also allow you to create your guild with the `/guildcreate` command. It is also possible to lose some of it in some events or mini events. Money can be earned in events, mini events, with a daily item or in the guild's rewards.

:star: **Experience**: The experience earned during your journey through the events will make you level-up. The higher your level is, the higher your stats will get and more possibilities will open to you : At level 4, you may buy your first class. At level 8, the fights will unlock and at level 10 the doors of the guilds will open to you.

:nauseated\_face:**State alteration**: A state alteration can occur if something bad happens to your character during a report. State alterations prevent the character from collecting points and disable certain aspects of the game for a period of time.

:briefcase: **Equipment**: Equipment can be discovered by your character during your adventure. They will be stored automatically in your inventory.

There are four types of equipment:

:dagger: **Weapon**: A weapon is a piece of equipment that increases the attack during fight. Weapons are automatically equipped.

:shield:**Armor**: Armor is a piece of equipment that increases defense during fight. The armor is automatically equipped.

:tropical\_drink: **Potion:** (well there is no emoji potion then...) A potion is a piece of equipment that can have various effects. Some potions can be drunk by the player using the command `/drink`, while other potions cannot be drunk and are used automatically during a fight.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Potions are the only pieces of equipment that cannot be sold using `/sell`. Instead, they'll be thrown away.
{% endhint %}

:key2: **Objects**: Objects can have various effects, they are the only pieces of equipment that can be transported in two copies by the player. Indeed, the player's inventory has a reserve and an active object. By default, the objects will be placed in the reserve which may contain a single object. To use the power of an object you have to place it in the "active object" box of the inventory using the `/switch` command, which will allow the use of the `/daily` command.

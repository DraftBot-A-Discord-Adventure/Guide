# Frequently asked questions

### How can I change the bot's language to english ?

Check if the right permissions (see below) are given to the bot:

If you gave the right permissions and the bot still won't answer, don't fret! You can still get help in the [official discord server](https://discord.com/invite/aJhQy4AtAA).&#x20;

### Can I add the bot to my discord server ?

YES ! The invite link is on the website ([http://draftbot.com/](http://draftbot.com)) or in the **#ðŸ‘‘-bienvenue** channel or in a pinned message on the **#ðŸ—£-gÃ©nÃ©ral** channel on the official discord server. A simple method is to click the link below :

{% embed url="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=448110812801007618&permissions=274878254144&scope=bot" %}

### &#x20;**What language is the bot developed in ?**

### **How is the bot hosted ?**

Right now I'm using OVH, but DigitalOcean, Amazon AWS and Google Cloud have been used in the past.

### **Can we see the bot's source code on GitHub or GitLab ?**

Yes, the bot is completely open source, and the full source code can be consulted here : [https://github.com/DraftBot-A-Discord-Adventure/](https://github.com/DraftBot-A-Discord-Adventure/Draftbot)

### **Why are there two DraftBot bots?**

There are indeed two bots named "DraftBot", but they share nothing in common, except their name. Both of their creators didn't plagiarize each other, as their purposes are entirely different! If you seek help from the other bot, we can only advise you to join their support server.

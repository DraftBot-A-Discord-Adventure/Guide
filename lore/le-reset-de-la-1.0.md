# The 1.0 reset

On April 24, 2019, the bot has been updated to version 1.0.0 after a big update. It is mostly called the "reset". It brought many new systems, and the bot has been quite completely rewritten.&#x20;

During this reset, every player's progression has been reset. The best player recieved a badge.

### Commands added

| Command   | Alias  | Description                                                                                                                                |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **drink** | **dr** | This command will let you drink the potion that you are carrying. Some of them can't be drinked, and will be automatically used in figths. |

### Deleted commands

Deleted the `!regen` and `!levelup` command, because those actions are now made automatically.

The `!topguild` command has been deleted, but will be remade a bit after, with the name of `!topserver`.

### &#x20;Profile system

The fight and profile interfaces have been completely renewed. To let you see, this was how the profile interface was like before and after the 1.0.0:

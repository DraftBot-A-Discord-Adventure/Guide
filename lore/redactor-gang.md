# Redactor Gang

The Redactor Gang, often called RG, was a team that managed the bot's redaction, translation, and addition of events to the bot.

Nowadays, adding a new event's content inside the bot is possible by everyone. If you wish to add an event to the bot, and if you are motivated, don't hesitate any further, and ask people for some advice in the bot's server !

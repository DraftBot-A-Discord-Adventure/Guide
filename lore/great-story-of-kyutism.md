# Great story of Kyutism

### Kyutism in general :

The religion is Kyutism, and its followers are called Kyutists. It is the religion of the DraftBot universe. There are three main types of followers :

* "Simple" followers, who practice Kyutism but have their own professions and lives alongside it.
* The religious ones.
* The members of the Order of Three, who are extremist Kyutists who reject the worship of Askeriel and worship the Trinity.

Followers practice their faith in churches with Kyutist priests, who live in a separate section of the church. The main relic is the Holy Kyu'spoon, and the priests officiate using a kyu'spoon, a large staff measuring 1.75 meters with an end shaped like a spoon. The religious book is called the Kyuran, which contains the history of the Kyutist gods (summarized below).

The religious hierarchy is structured as follows:

* The Kyuptain is the spiritual leader of Kyutism and resides in the Cathedral of Claire de Ville.
* The High Priest is the Kyucaptain's right-hand person, assisting and traveling to spread Kyutism throughout the country and convey Kyuptain's message.
* Kyutist Monks meditate and pray in their distant monasteries and churches, sustaining themselves through the trade of agricultural products, such as farming, brewing beer, or cultivation.
* Kyutist priests officiate in cities and villages across the country.
* The majority of the population consists of followers.

### Kyuran

The Kyuran is an ancient book that recounts the founding legends of Kyutism. It also includes various presentations of the different icons.

It is said that the book possesses magical powers, but this information is difficult to verify as the few existing copies are highly sought after and expensive.

#### The Genesis :

In primordial times, there was only Askeriel, floating in the abyss. One day, he had the idea to use his powers to create something more. Thus, he created the world, life, and everything that follows, shaping it all with his Kyu'spoon. Once the world was created, he made Humans his representatives. They began to worship him. However, as time passed, Askeriel took pity on his proteges because they couldn't distinguish themselves from other species and were inherently weak. To provide more support to these weak Humans, he created his right-hand deities and brought forth the Trinity. He delegated a portion of his authority to each of these three gods and stepped back to observe the world without solely directing it.

#### The Trinity :

The Trinity represents balance and humanity's progress:

* Orthgard is a deceased angel who represents humanity's technological progress. He taught them how to create tools and protect themselves from the outside world. He manages the souls of people judged as good by Iatneh and is represented by a ring.
* Iatneh is a Minotaur who embodies balance and justice. His authority extends to law and judgmental values. He taught humans how to live in groups, think, and organize themselves. He judges people's souls upon their death and sends them to Orthgard or Fenrir based on his judgment. His symbol is an urn.
* Fenrir is a silver werewolf who showed humans how to defend themselves with weapons, poisons, and how to protect themselves through medicine. He handles the souls of people judged as bad by Iatneh. His symbol is the wolf.

These gods are also revered during religious festivals dedicated to each of them. The three festivals, along with the Creation Festivals that honor Askeriel, are the major events.

There is one more deity, Y'ahnor, who is currently dormant and represents destruction.

### The Sect

The sect is a group of extremist Kyutists who reject Askeriel. They call themselves the Order of Three and believe that Askeriel is dead, dethroned by the Trinity on Y'ahnor's advice because he was unworthy of ruling the world and humanity, hindering their goal of guiding humanity. They are led by the three Blusters, each symbolizing the incarnation of one of the three Gods of the Trinity on Earth. According to them, all the gods are fundamentally evil (which is not the case in Kyutism). They know that they will go to Fenrir upon their death due to their actions, but they hope to receive a more lenient fate by performing various sacrifices in honor of Fenrir while alive. Their ultimate goal is to awaken Y'ahnor through human sacrifices, so that she may guide humanity to rule the world alongside the Three.

# Missions

Missions are goals that players have to realize to earn experience and gems. To check your ongoing missions, use the `/missions` command.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also check out another player's missions by adding the `user` or `rank` parameters from the aforementioned command. For example, `/missions rank:777` will display missions from the user who's ranked 777th.
{% endhint %}

### Mission categories

&#x20;There are 3 types of missions:

* Campaign missions: they don't change and are preset : there are 60 of them and their difficulty is evolving with the player.
* Daily missions: as their name implies, they change every day and make the player earn rewards in a different way than campaign missions.
* Secondary missions are another possibility to earn rewards, they can be found occasionally in specific small events.

Secondary missions can be found on small events that look like this:

### The missions store

Gems that are earned by completing campaign and daily missions can be spent on the missions shop. You can access the latter with the `/missionsshop` command.

It is divided in 3 categories:

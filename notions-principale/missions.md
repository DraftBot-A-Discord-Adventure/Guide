# Missions

Missions are goals that players have to realize to earn experience and gems. There are 3 types of missions:

* Campaign missions: they don't change and are predefined : there are 59 of them and their difficulty is evolving with the player.
* Daily missions: as their name suggests, they change every day and make the player earn rewards in a different way than campaign missions.
* Secondary missions are another possibility to earn rewards, they can be found occasionally in simple reports.

Gems earned can be spent in the missions shop. It is divided in 3 categories:

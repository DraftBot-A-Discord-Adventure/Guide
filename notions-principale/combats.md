### Figths types

#### Normal fight

A normal fight can be started with the `!fight` command. You can add a `@user` option just after the command, to specify a user to fight. If you are not the creator of the fight, and if you don't have any state alteration, you can click on the ✅ emoji in reaction. In these type of fights, the winner earns points, and the defeated player looses some.

#### Friendly fights

The friendly fights works the same as the normal fights, no one is loosing or earning points at the end. To start one you can run the `!friendlyfight` command.

### Progress of a fight

The fight is a turn by turn system. At every turn you will have to choose between 6 options :

⚔  **Simple attack**: An attack that has normal chances to succeed.

🗡  **Fast attack**: An attack that has good chanced of succeeding if you are faster than your enemy.

⚒  **Heavy attack**: the chances of succeeding are low, but it makes much damages.

💣  **Ultimate attack**: an attack on 2 tuns, that is efficient if you have a lower speed than your enemy. She removes around 2/3 of your opponent's life.

🛡  **Defense**: Grow your defense up. The defense allows you to take lower damages. The more this action is use, the less it will be efficient.

🚀 **Speed**: Get faster. If your speed is about your opponent's, your chance of succeeding an attack are higher except for the ultimate attack. The most the action is used, the less it will be efficient.

### Victory conditions

 The fight ends when the life of one of the opponents health points💙 are about 0, or if one of the players doesn't answer for 30 seconds. If the 25th turn is reached, the fight will end in equality. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
After each fights the health points 💙 are not given back instantly.

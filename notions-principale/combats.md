### Fight types

#### Normal fight

A normal fight can be started with the `!fight` command. You can add a `@user` option just after the command, to specify a user to fight. If you are not the creator of the fight, and if you don't have any state alteration, you can click on the :white\_check\_mark: emoji in reaction. In these type of fights, the winner earns points, and the defeated player looses some.

#### Friendly fights

The friendly fights works the same as the normal fights but no one is losing or earning points at the end. To start one you can run the`!friendlyfight` command.

### Progress of a fight

The fight is a turn by turn system. At every turn you will have to choose between 6 options :

:crossed\_swords: | **Simple attack**: An attack that has normal chances to succeed.

:dagger: | **Fast attack**: An attack that has good chances of succeeding if you're faster than your enemy.

:hammer: |  **Heavy attack**: The chances of succeeding are low, but it deals much more damage.

:bomb: | **Ultimate attack**: An attack on 2 turns, that is efficient if you have a lower speed than your enemy. This deals around 2/3 of your opponent's life.

:firecracker: | **Bulk attack**: This attack deals damage to all fighters, useful if you have more defenses than you enemy.

:rocket: **Speed**: Increases your speed. If your speed is about your opponent's, your chance of succeeding an attack are higher except for the ultimate attack. The most the action is used, the less it will be efficient.

{% hint style="info" %}
The person with more speed gets first turn.

### Victory conditions

The fight ends when a fighter's life drops to 0, If fighters don't answer after 30 seconds or when the turn number 25 is reached. When the fight ends, you'll probably lose energy. But it'll be recovered over time.&#x20;

After each fight the energy points :zap: are not given back instantly.

## What is DraftBot ?

DraftBot is a Discord bot developed by [@BastLast](https://github.com/BastLast) that allows you to live a textual adventure.&#x20;

The story takes place in a medieval world where the player controls an adventurer who must win a competition organized by the king to win the hand of the princess. To achieve his goal, he must travel, collect points and face many dangers. The game takes place in real-time, and the player is regularly prompted to request "reports" from the character they are controlling. During these reports, the character may seek advice from the player through a choice system using Discord reactions. Each choice leads the character to beneficial or detrimental consequences. Throughout his journey, the character may be injured, collect different equipment, etc.

The inventory is the place in which every items found in the reports, or bougth in the shop are stored. To check an inventory's content, type the `/inventory` command.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can check out someone else's inventory as well! Use the `user` or `rank` options of that command to do so. For example, `/inventory rank:42` will showcase the inventory of the user who's ranked 42nd.

### Organization of the inventory

![This is someone else's inventory, for example.](<../.gitbook/assets/Capture d’écran 2023-05-06 à 17.16.07.png>)

The inventory is organized in two distinct parts: one that showcases the equipped items, and the other which displays what the player has kept for future use.

The inventory is divided in 4 parts:

* The weapon slot
* The armor slot
* The potion slot
* The item slot

The item stock will keep additional equipments that you can switch with your currently equipped ones depending on your needs.

The player's items stock can be improved on the shop. Various slots are available to buy:

* 1 weapon slot
* 1 armor slot
* 3 potion slots
* 3 item slots
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
When buying an additional slot, the option's price will increase in consequence.
{% endhint %}

### Interacting with the inventory's items

The `/dailybonus` command allows the user to use the item placed in the "Active object" slot. An item can be used every 22h minimum if it's not a fighting bonus.

The `/sell` command lets you sell any of your stock's equipment (except the potions, which you can only throw away).

The `/switch` command can be used to switch an active item with a stored one.

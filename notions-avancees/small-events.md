# Small events

There are 25 small event types in the bot at the time this page is being written. Below are some informations about them which will allow you to plan your journey more strategically.

The higher a small event's rarity is, the more frequent it is.

{% hint style="info" %}
The current maximum rarity (by analogy, the rarity that can be known as the most common) is 12.
{% endhint %}

### Wandering shop

**Rarity: 4**

This small event lets you buy an equipment for 60% of its original price (most of the time). It can't sell you equipements rarer than the Special rarity. If you buy the seller's equipment but won't replace your currently-stored one, it'll be given back to the seller for a bit less than its buying price.

{% hint style="danger" %}
However, there is a small proportion of sellers who will attempt to scam you by having their items sold at 5 times the original price!
{% endhint %}

### Interaction with the pet

**Rarity: 10** | Needs to have a pet accompanying you. Otherwise, this small event won't appear.

This small event indicates an interaction between you and your pet. It can be helpful or not depending on the pet's love. Rarer pets may grant you better rewards.

| Reward                 | Minimum rarity | Probability |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Money (20 to 70)       | 3              | High        |
| Food                   | 1              | Normal      |
| Item                   | 5              | Low         |
| Health (1 to 5)        | 4              | Normal      |
| Nothing happens        | 1              | Very high   |

| Energy (10 to 250)     | 1              | High        |

{% hint style="success" %}
If your pet is trained, it will count as having an additional star, thus getting more bonuses accessible to you. For example, a trained 4:star: pet will count as a 5:star: pet.
{% endhint %}

| Malus                           | Probability |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Damage (1 to 5)                 | Normal      |
| Loss of money (20 to 70)        | Normal      |
| Waste of time (5 to 20 minutes) | Normal      |
| Hate (1 to 3)                   | Normal      |

### Finding a pet

**Rarity: 2**

You will meet a pet which will join you during your adventure. If you already have one, and if you belong to a guild, the newest pet will be stored in the guild's shelter.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you don't belong to a guild, or your guild's shelter is full and you already have a pet with you, this small event won't give you any new one. However, in some cases, it may give you some meat if you belong in a guild.
{% endhint %}

The probability to obtain a pet of a specific rarity is as follows:

<table><thead><tr><th width="97"></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1 <span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="2b50">⭐</span></td><td>2 <span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="2b50">⭐</span></td><td>3<span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="2b50">⭐</span></td><td>4<span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="2b50">⭐</span></td><td>5<span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="2b50">⭐</span></td></tr><tr><td>87.6%</td><td>9.64%</td><td>1.664%</td><td>0.65%</td><td>0.446%</td></tr></tbody></table>
